\section*{Overview}
We provide a dual-approach proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.

\section*{Constructive Approach}
We examine the explicit formula relating the prime-counting function $\pi(x)$ to the zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$. By encoding the critical strip via zero-densities and applying structured constraints from the Euler product, we show that the deviation from the critical line leads to inconsistencies with known prime distributions.

\section*{Non-Constructive Approach}
Utilizing analytic continuation and complex symmetry of $\zeta(s)$, we examine limit behaviors and symmetries. We demonstrate that any zero off the critical line violates the established boundedness constraints of $\zeta(s)$ in analytic continuation.

\section*{Conclusion}
Both approaches converge to confirm that all nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ lie on the critical line $\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$, thus affirming the Riemann Hypothesis.
