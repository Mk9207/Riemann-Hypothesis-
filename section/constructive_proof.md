## Constructive Proof

This section outlines a structured attempt to verify the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line.

### Outline:
1. Definition of the Riemann zeta function
2. Euler product and critical strip
3. Argument by complex analysis with structured mapping
4. Hypothesis validation through convergence behavior
